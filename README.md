# DIDI-Algorithm-Competition

It's a repository on the competition, while I gave up optimization due to my teammate-duducheng was busy at that time.

The best rank of the competition is ~70+ / 917. (During the competition, with a score of ~0.34, the best at that time was ~ 0.27).

We used random forest + k-means.
